- Working as a systems integrator on a variety of projects: new line control and integration, line modifications/additions, PLC conversion, and troubleshooting for primary packaging, secondary packaging, palletizing, and process.
- Creating functional requirement specifications detailing control methodology; types and quantities of sensors, motors, VFDs/starters, control stations, E-Stops; device locations; and machine interlocks. Writing PLC programs and creating HMI applications per the FRS.
- Designing control panels by detailing parts, quantities, power and cooling requirements, and performing design reviews.
- Provide a direct interface with clients through functional requirement specification reviews, HMI and PLC simulations, project update meetings, and remote and onsite support.
- Extensive involvement in system startup and contractor management. Responsible for writing electrical contractor scopes of work and maintaining contact with client and contractors. Leading efforts in commissioning field devices, setting VFD parameters, configuring managed ethernet switches, and testing interlocks. Other tasks include writing daily reports, creating training documentation, performing system training, and documenting as-builts.
- Implemented array bit shift to track and perform rejects for various sized SKUs using inputs from open flap detectors, barcode scanners, and checkweighers without the use of an encoder.
- Acted as single dedicated controls resource for line control replacement project that involved upgrading four processors from SLC 5/04 to SLC 5/05 and modifying OEM interlocks from hardwire, RIO, and DH+ to ethernet messaging. Reached targeted 3% OEE increase in first week of startup.
- Promoted to controls lead for $1.3MM new production line project involving integration of 12 pieces of OEM equipment, 43 new conveyor motors, single ViewSE application for line control and all OEM screens, and utilities system with 3 PLC programs using PlantPAx to control 70+ new devices. Line was producing product on originally scheduled startup date.
