I was involved in the [Purdue IEEE Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV)](https://purdueieee.org/rov/) team while in school. 

I started as a member of the Electronics Tube project team where we designed and fabricated waterproof end caps	to house the ROV's electrical components. That year at the 2017 international competition, our team won Best Product Presentation and Best Technical Documentation.

From 2017-2019, I was the Tools Team project group head. In this role, I managed six people and led development and manufacturing of mission-specific tools.
